0.11.X is still Under Development

ce1sus
=======

ce1sus is a threat information database.

When the development of ce1sus started there were not many tools available to store Indicators of compromise (IOCs) available.
Moreover the shared IOCs were received in many different formats, and often there was no real context given.  

ce1sus has the goal to facilitate:

1. Central database: Storing any information around all kinds of threads (i.e. scam, malware, phishing, ...). in a structured manner 
2. Sharing: Be compatible with open standards (STIX/Cybox) / or the most commonly used formats to facilitate the sharing trusted partners
3. Automatized Import/Export: Synchronization of instances between trusted partners
4. Ease of use: Generate informations out of the obvious automatically (i.e. hashes, parsing of email headers, etc)
5. Correlation: Automatically creating relations between seen threats
6. Visualization: Represent the threat/analysis as close as possible to the  the real-life case in a structured manner

The structuration of a threat provides context to others with nearly no efforts. An Example 

Example:
Email with a malicious attachment

In such cases the event should start by an email object. 
That object then can have all the attributes (i.e. email_from, email_body, ...) required to represent an email. 
This object then will get a child object representing the attachment. 
If now this file is just a dropper then the dropped file should be a child of the previous object and so forth.

For this scenario one can directly deduce that then a child file was found that it is highly probable that the file came from this specific dropper
and if the dropper file was not found one at least knows that the cases are related.  

Such structures improve the understanding how the the different attributes are related and leads to a better overview on relations between events.

Note
----

There are several branches, which are primarly used for development the master branch will be the release which is considered as stable

This is still not the final release, we are still developing ce1sus.
