0.11.X is still Under Development

ce1sus
=======

ce1sus is a threat information database.

The purpose of ce1sus is to store any information around all kinds of threads (i.e. scam, malware, phishing, ...). in a structured manner and share this information with trusted partners.

Ce1sus entries are modeled to represent the real-life case as as close as possible. 

Example:
Email with a malicious attachment

In such cases the event should start by an email object. That object then can have all the attributes (i.e. email_from, email_body, ...) required to represent an email. This object then will get a child object representing the attachment. If now this file is just a dropper then the dropped file should be a child of the previous object and so forth.

Such structured events improve the understanding how the the different attributes are related and leads to a better overview on relations between events.

Note
----

This is still not the final release, we are still developing ce1sus.

For any questions write a mail to the developers
