# ce1sus a Thread Information Database #

NOTE: This is still not the final release, but the database wont change. For any questions write a mail to the developers

The purpose of ce1sus is to store any information around any kind of thread in a structured manner and 
share this information with trusted partners. The threads contained in this database can be of any type (i.e. scam, malware) and
the modeled event in ce1sus should represent the real case it self. 

Example:
Email with a malicious attachment

In such cases the event should be composed of an email object which has a a child the attachment. 
The child on his side can also have children when for instance the file drops other files. Each object should also have
their respective attributes, which can later be used to relate the event to other events.

The structurization provides helps for a better understanding of the provenances of the different attributes and this leads
to a better overview how the events are related.




Features:
* Creates relations between events through their attributes
* Stores and presents the event in a structured manner
* Different levels of sharing 
* Easy maintenance
* Flexible configuration and taxonomy
* Easy installation
* Completely open source
* Improved Search
