# ce1sus a Thread Information Database #

The purpose of ce1sus is to store any information around all kinds of threads (i.e. scam, malware, phishing, ...). in a structured manner and share this information with trusted partners. 

The ce1sus events is designed to represent the real-life case as as close as possible. 

Example:
Email with a malicious attachment

In such cases the event should start by an email object. That object then can have all the attributes (i.e. email_from, email_body, ...) required to represent an email. This object then will get a child object representing the attachment. If now this file is just a dropper then the dropped file should be a child of the previous object and so forth.

Such structurization provides help for a better understanding of the provenances of the different attributes and this leads to a better overview how the events are related.
